## Refactoring a clients website.

[link to the website](https://teelsam.github.io/Week1Challenge/)

Given a _on-the-job-ticket_ to help a marketing agency update its website to follow accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines, I have gone through the code and altered it to be more accesible both through screen readers, and to future coders who may want to alter the site in the future. I have learned the power of connecting html aspects to their css altration area. Along with ways to alter sizes and shapes of colored background blocks to fit a design and website content.

## Table of Contents

An html file named index, a css file called style.css and a folder of images used to design and beautify the websites content. Along with this README file.

## Correct Viewport

Although we havent learned about setting websites viewport, when I was working towards having no errors in my code DevTools gave me a warning about not having this piece of code in my head of my index file. So reading their linked page on viewport importance I put the line in. Their documentation can be read here:
This is the WebHint foundations documentation on what viewports are and how they can be functionally added to a persons code [WebHint.io](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-meta-viewport/?source=devtools)
Line 6 in my index.html file i added the code `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />` which I got from webhints site.
