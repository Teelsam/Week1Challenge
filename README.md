## Refactoring a clients website.
(https://teelsam.github.io/Week1Challenge/)

Given a _on-the-job-ticket_ to help a marketing agency update its website to follow accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines, I have gone through the code and altered it to be more accesible both through screen readers and to future coders who may want to alter the site in the future. I have learned the power of connecting html aspects to their css altration area. Along with ways to alter sizes and shapes of colored background blocks to fit a design and website content.

## Table of Contents

An html file named index, a css file called style.css and a folder of images used to design and beautify the websites content. Along with this README file.
